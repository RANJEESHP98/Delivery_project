# Delivery_project


1) Performing EDA
  

a. Importing the libaries

b. importing and loading the datasets.

c. Analysing the datasets using head,tail,iloc,duplicates and describe the functions.

d. Finding the missing values and treating them with mean values.

e. Making the target value mentioning it as delivery in minitues

f. Finding the outliers using sknewness and visualize it through boxplot and scatter plot.

g. Treating the outliers using IQR 

h. Feature Engineering. Adding the columns and removing the 
   unnescessary columns.

i. Using threold value finding the delay and visua;liseing through barplot.

j. Based on the courier id finding the top 10 heighest courier deliveries.

k. Converting the catagorical values into numeric values.

l. Splitting the data into target values and features.

2. Testing and training the valuess.

a. Using models like linear,decision Tree,Random forest Regressor and svr predicting of deliveries with real.

b. Evaluate the models with MSE,MAE,R2 square and the finding the best model for predicting it.

3. Findings.
